# Vault placeholder

This folder is used to store vaulted files, and the dotfiles role looks here for a file named "dotfiles.yml". 

The file does not need to be vaulted, but it does contain sensitive information so it probably should be 

The `.gitignore` housed within this directory ignores all .yml files. If you want to store your file here in Git, either change the file extension to yaml or modify the gitignore.

Thanks!
